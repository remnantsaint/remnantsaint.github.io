The token has to be made available in your CI environment via the `GH_TOKEN` environment variable. The user associated with the token must have push permission to the repository.\n\nWhen creating the token, the **minimum required scopes** are:\n\n- [`repo`](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new?scopes=repo) for a private repository\n- [`public_repo`](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new?scopes=public_repo) for a public repository\n\n_Note on GitHub Actions:_ You can use the default token which is provided in the secret _GITHUB_TOKEN_. However releases done with this token will NOT trigger release events to start other workflows.\nIf you have actions that trigger on newly created releases, please use a generated token for that and store it in your repository's secrets (any other name than GITHUB_TOKEN is fine).\n\nWhen using the _GITHUB_TOKEN_, the **minimum required permissions** are:\n\n- `contents: write` to be able to publish a GitHub release\n- `issues: write` to be able to comment on released issues\n- `pull-requests: write` to be able to comment on released pull requests\n\n### Environment variables\n\n| Variable                       | Description                                                         |\n| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `GITHUB_TOKEN` or `GH_TOKEN`   | **Required.** The token used to authenticate with GitHub.           |\n| `GITHUB_URL` or `GH_URL`       | The GitHub server endpoint.                                         |\n| `GITHUB_PREFIX` or `GH_PREFIX` | The GitHub API prefix, relative to `GITHUB_URL`.                    |\n| `GITHUB_API_URL`               | The GitHub API endpoint.
