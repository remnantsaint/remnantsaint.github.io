You can use WebdriverIO as a standalone package or via a test runner using [`@wdio/cli`](https://webdriver.io/docs/clioptions). WebdriverIO allows you to run tests locally using the WebDriver as well as remote user agents using cloud providers like [Sauce Labs](https://saucelabs.com/).\n\n## Installation\n\nYou can install WebdriverIO via NPM:\n\n```sh\nnpm install webdriverio\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nWebdriverIO by default uses Puppeteer to automate a browser like Chrome, Firefox or Chromium Edge. So if you have Chrome installed, the following script should start a browser for you and get the title of the page:\n\n```js\nimport { remote } from 'webdriverio'\n\nconst browser = await remote({\n    capabilities: { browserName: 'chrome' }\n})\n\nawait browser.navigateTo('https://www.google.com/ncr')\n\nconst searchInput = await browser.$('#lst-ib')\nawait searchInput.setValue('WebdriverIO')\n\nconst searchBtn = await browser.$('input[value=\"Google Search\"]')\nawait searchBtn.click()\n\nconsole.log(await browser.getTitle()) // outputs \"WebdriverIO - Google Search\"\n\nawait browser.deleteSession()\n```\n\nSee the raw [protocol example](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webdriver#example) using the `webdriver` package to get a glance at the differences.\n\nFor more information on [options](https://webdriver.io/docs/options#webdriver-options), [multiremote usage](https://webdriver.io/docs/multiremote) or integration into [cloud services](https://webdriver.io/docs/cloudservices) please check out the [docs](https://webdriver.io/docs/gettingstarted).\n\n---\n\n<center>Package Sponsors:</center>\n<p align=\"center\">\n    <a
