I started out just stripping out the browser-specific code and tidying up some of the javascript to work better in node. It grew from there. Although it's got a similar name to the Java library [log4j](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/), thinking that it will behave the same way will only bring you sorrow and confusion.\n\nThe full documentation is available [here](https://log4js-node.github.io/log4js-node/).\n\n[Changes in version 3.x](https://log4js-node.github.io/log4js-node/v3-changes.md)\n\nThere have been a few changes between log4js 1.x and 2.x (and 0.x too). You should probably read this [migration guide](https://log4js-node.github.io/log4js-node/migration-guide.html) if things aren't working.\n\nOut of the box it supports the following features:\n\n- coloured console logging to stdout or stderr\n- file appender, with configurable log rolling based on file size or date\n- a logger for connect/express servers\n- configurable log message layout/patterns\n- different log levels for different log categories (make some parts of your app log as DEBUG, others only ERRORS, etc.)\n\nOptional appenders are available:\n\n- [SMTP](https://github.com/log4js-node/smtp)\n- [GELF](https://github.com/log4js-node/gelf)\n- [Loggly](https://github.com/log4js-node/loggly)\n- Logstash ([UDP](https://github.com/log4js-node/logstashUDP) and [HTTP](https://github.com/log4js-node/logstashHTTP))\n- logFaces ([UDP](https://github.com/log4js-node/logFaces-UDP) and [HTTP](https://github.com/log4js-node/logFaces-HTTP))\n- [RabbitMQ](https://github.com/log4js-node/rabbitmq)\n- [Redis](https://github.com/log4js-node/redis)\n- [Hipchat](https://github.com/log4js-node/hipchat)\n- [Slack](https://github.com/log4js-node/slack)\n- [mailgun](https://github.com/log4js-node/mailgun)\n- [InfluxDB](https://github.com/rnd-debug/log4js-influxdb-appender)\n\n## Getting help\n\nHaving problems? Jump on the [slack](https://join.slack.com/t/log4js-node/shared_invite/enQtODkzMDQ3MzExMDczLWUzZmY0MmI0YWI1ZjFhODY0YjI0YmU1N2U5ZTRkOTYyYzg3MjY5NWI4M2FjZThjYjdiOGM0NjU2NzBmYTJjOGI) channel, or create an issue. If you want to help out with the development, the slack channel is a good place to go as well.\n\n## installation\n\n```bash\nnpm install log4js\n```\n\n## usage\n\nMinimalist version:\n\n```javascript\nvar log4js = require(\"log4js\");\nvar logger = log4js.getLogger();\nlogger.level = \"debug\";\nlogger.debug(\"Some debug messages\");\n```\n\nBy default, log4js will not output any logs (so that it can safely be used in libraries). The `level` for the `default` category is set to `OFF`. To enable logs, set the level (as in the example). This will then output to stdout with the coloured layout (thanks to [masylum](http://github.com/masylum)), so for the above you would see:\n\n```bash\n[2010-01-17 11:43:37.987] [DEBUG] [default] - Some debug messages\n```\n\nSee example.js for a full example, but here's a snippet (also in `examples/fromreadme.js`):\n\n```javascript\nconst log4js = require(\"log4js\");\nlog4js.configure({\n  appenders: { cheese: { type: \"file\", filename: \"cheese.log\" } },\n  categories: { default: { appenders: [\"cheese\"], level: \"error\" } },\n});\n\nconst logger = log4js.getLogger(\"cheese\");\nlogger.trace(\"Entering cheese testing\");\nlogger.debug(\"Got cheese.\");\nlogger.info(\"Cheese is Comté.\");\nlogger.warn(\"Cheese is quite smelly.\");\nlogger.error(\"Cheese is too ripe!\");\nlogger.fatal(\"Cheese was breeding ground for listeria.\");\n```\n\nOutput (in `cheese.log`):\n\n```bash\n[2010-01-17 11:43:37.987] [ERROR] cheese - Cheese is too ripe!\n[2010-01-17 11:43:37.990] [FATAL] cheese - Cheese was breeding ground for listeria.\n```\n\n## Note for library makers\n\nIf you're writing a library and would like to include support for log4js, without introducing a dependency headache for your users, take a look at [log4js-api](https://github.com/log4js-node/log4js-api).\n\n## Documentation\n\nAvailable [here](https://log4js-node.github.io/log4js-node/).\n\nThere's also [an example application](https://github.com/log4js-node/log4js-example).\n\n## TypeScript\n\n```ts\nimport * as log4js from \"log4js\";\nlog4js.configure({\n  appenders: { cheese: { type: \"file\", filename: \"cheese.log\" } },\n  categories: { default: { appenders: [\"cheese\"], level: \"error\" } },\n});\n\nconst logger = log4js.getLogger();\nlogger.level = \"debug\";\nlogger.debug(\"Some debug messages\");\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\nWe're always looking for people to help out. Jump on [slack](https://join.slack.com/t/log4js-node/shared_invite/enQtODkzMDQ3MzExMDczLWUzZmY0MmI0YWI1ZjFhODY0YjI0YmU1N2U5ZTRkOTYyYzg3MjY5NWI4M2FjZThjYjdiOGM0NjU2NzBmYTJjOGI) and discuss what you want to do.
