AVA cannot be run globally.*\n\nDon't forget to configure the `test` script in your `package.json` as per above.\n\n### Create your test file\n\nCreate a file named `test.js` in the project root directory.\n\n_Note that AVA's documentation assumes you're using ES modules._\n\n```js\nimport test from 'ava';\n\ntest('foo', t => {\n\tt.pass();\n});\n\ntest('bar', async t => {\n\tconst bar = Promise.resolve('bar');\n\tt.is(await bar, 'bar');\n});\n```\n\n### Running your tests\n\n```console\nnpm test\n```\n\nOr with `npx`:\n\n```console\nnpx ava\n```\n\nRun with the `--watch` flag to enable AVA's [watch mode](docs/recipes/watch-mode.md):\n\n```console\nnpx ava --watch\n```\n\n## Supported Node.js versions\n\nAVA supports the latest release of any major version that [is supported by Node.js itself](https://github.com/nodejs/Release#release-schedule). Read more in our [support statement](docs/support-statement.md).\n\n## Highlights\n\n### Magic assert\n\nAVA adds code excerpts and clean diffs for actual and expected values. If values in the assertion are objects or arrays, only a diff is displayed, to remove the noise and focus on the problem. The diff is syntax-highlighted too! If you are comparing strings, both single and multi line, AVA displays a different kind of output, highlighting the added or missing characters.\n\n![](media/magic-assert-combined.png)\n\n### Clean stack traces\n\nAVA automatically removes unrelated lines in stack traces, allowing you to find the source of an error much faster, as seen above.\n\n### Parallel runs in CI\n\nAVA automatically detects whether your CI environment supports parallel builds. Each build will run a subset of all test files, while still making sure all tests get executed. See the [`ci-parallel-vars`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ci-parallel-vars) package for a list of supported CI environments.\n\n## Documentation\n\nPlease see the [files in the `docs` directory](./docs):\n\n* [Writing tests](./docs/01-writing-tests.md)\n* [Execution context](./docs/02-execution-context.md)\n* [Assertions](./docs/03-assertions.md)\n* [Snapshot testing](./docs/04-snapshot-testing.md)\n* [Command line (CLI)](./docs/05-command-line.md)\n* [Configuration](./docs/06-configuration.md)\n* [Test timeouts](./docs/07-test-timeouts.md)\n\n### Common pitfalls\n\nWe have a growing list of [common pitfalls](docs/08-common-pitfalls.md) you may experience while using AVA. If you encounter any issues you think are common, comment in [this issue](https://github.com/avajs/ava/issues/404).\n\n### Recipes\n\n- [Test setup](docs/recipes/test-setup.md)\n- [TypeScript](docs/recipes/typescript.md)\n- [Shared workers](docs/recipes/shared-workers.md)\n- [Watch mode](docs/recipes/watch-mode.md)\n- [When to use `t.plan()`](docs/recipes/when-to-use-plan.md)\n- [Passing arguments to your test files](docs/recipes/passing-arguments-to-your-test-files.md)\n- [Splitting tests in CI](docs/recipes/splitting-tests-ci.md)\n- [Code coverage](docs/recipes/code-coverage.md)\n- [Endpoint testing](docs/recipes/endpoint-testing.md)\n- [Browser testing](docs/recipes/browser-testing.md)\n- [Testing Vue.js components](docs/recipes/vue.md)\n- [Debugging tests with Chrome DevTools](docs/recipes/debugging-with-chrome-devtools.md)\n- [Debugging tests with VSCode](docs/recipes/debugging-with-vscode.md)\n- [Debugging tests with WebStorm](docs/recipes/debugging-with-webstorm.md)\n- [Isolated MongoDB integration tests](docs/recipes/isolated-mongodb-integration-tests.md)\n- [Testing web apps using Puppeteer](docs/recipes/puppeteer.md)\n- [Testing web apps using Selenium WebDriverJS](docs/recipes/testing-with-selenium-webdriverjs.md)\n\n## FAQ\n\n### How is the name written and pronounced?\n\nAVA, not Ava or ava. Pronounced [`/ˈeɪvə/`](media/pronunciation.m4a?raw=true): Ay (f**a**ce, m**a**de) V (**v**ie, ha**v**e) A (comm**a**, **a**go)\n\n### What is the header background?\n\nIt's the [Andromeda galaxy](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andromeda_galaxy).\n\n### What is the difference between concurrency and parallelism?\n\n[Concurrency is not parallelism. It enables parallelism.](https://stackoverflow.com/q/1050222)\n\n## Support\n\n- [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/avajs/ava/discussions)\n\n## Related\n\n- [eslint-plugin-ava](https://github.com/avajs/eslint-plugin-ava) — Lint rules for AVA tests\n- [@ava/typescript](https://github.com/avajs/typescript) — Test TypeScript projects\n- [@ava/cooperate](https://github.com/avajs/cooperate) — Low-level primitives to enable cooperation between test files\n- [@ava/get-port](https://github.com/avajs/get-port) — Reserve a port while testing\n\n## Links\n\n- [AVA stickers, t-shirts, etc](https://www.redbubble.com/people/sindresorhus/works/30330590-ava-logo)\n- [Awesome list](https://github.com/avajs/awesome-ava)\n- [Do you like AVA?
