This includes files in which no replacements were made.\n\nEach result contains the following values:\n\n- `file`: The path to the file that was processed\n- `hasChanged`: Flag to indicate if the file was changed or not\n\n```js\nconst results = replaceInFileSync({\n  files: 'path/to/files/*.html',\n  from: /foo/g,\n  to: 'bar',\n})\n\nconsole.log(results)\n\n// [\n//   {\n//     file: 'path/to/files/file1.html',\n//     hasChanged: true,\n//   },\n//   {\n//     file: 'path/to/files/file2.html',\n//     hasChanged: true,\n//   },\n//   {\n//     file: 'path/to/files/file3.html',\n//     hasChanged: false,\n//   },\n// ]\n\n```\n\nTo get an array of changed files, simply map the results as follows:\n\n```js\nconst changedFiles = results\n  .filter(result => result.hasChanged)\n  .map(result => result.file)\n```\n\n### Counting matches and replacements\nBy setting the `countMatches` configuration flag to `true`, the number of matches and replacements per file will be counted and present in the results array.\n\n- `numMatches`: Indicates the number of times a match was found in the file\n- `numReplacements`: Indicates the number of times a replacement was made in the file\n\nNote that the number of matches can be higher than the number of replacements if a match and replacement are the same string.\n\n```js\nconst results = replaceInFileSync({\n  files: 'path/to/files/*.html',\n  from: /foo/g,\n  to: 'bar',\n  countMatches: true,\n})\n\nconsole.log(results)\n\n// [\n//   {\n//     file: 'path/to/files/file1.html',\n//     hasChanged: true,\n//     numMatches: 3,\n//     numReplacements: 3,\n//   },\n//   {\n//     file: 'path/to/files/file2.html',\n//     hasChanged: true,\n//     numMatches: 1,\n//     numReplacements: 1,\n//   },\n//   {\n//     file: 'path/to/files/file3.html',\n//     hasChanged: false,\n//     numMatches: 0,\n//     numReplacements: 0,\n//   },\n// ]\n```\n\n## Advanced usage\n\n### Replace a single file or glob\n```js\nconst options = {\n  files: 'path/to/file',\n}\n```\n\n### Replace multiple files or globs\n\n```js\nconst options = {\n  files: [\n    'path/to/file',\n    'path/to/other/file',\n    'path/to/files/*.html',\n    'another/**/*.path',\n  ],\n}\n```\n\n### Replace first occurrence only\n\n```js\nconst options = {\n  from: 'foo',\n  to: 'bar',\n}\n```\n\n### Replace all occurrences\nPlease note that the value specified in the `from` parameter is passed straight to the native [String replace method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/replace). As such, if you pass a string as the `from` parameter, it will _only replace the first occurrence_.\n\nTo replace multiple occurrences at once, you must use a regular expression for the `from` parameter with the global flag enabled, e.g. `/foo/g`.\n\n```js\nconst options = {\n  from: /foo/g,\n  to: 'bar',\n}\n```\n\n### Multiple values with the same replacement\n\nThese will be replaced sequentially.\n\n```js\nconst options = {\n  from: [/foo/g, /baz/g],\n  to: 'bar',\n}\n```\n\n### Multiple values with different replacements\n\nThese will be replaced sequentially.\n\n```js\nconst options = {\n  from: [/foo/g, /baz/g],\n  to: ['bar', 'bax'],\n}\n```\n\n### Multiple replacements with different options\n\nThere is no direct API in this package to make multiple replacements on different files with different options. However, you can easily accomplish this in your scripts as follows:\n\n```js\nconst replacements = [\n  {\n    files: 'path/to/file1',\n    from: /foo/g,\n    to: 'bar',\n  },\n  {\n    files: 'path/to/file2',\n    from: /bar/g,\n    to: 'foo',\n  }\n]\n\nawait Promise.all(\n  replacements.map(options => replaceInFile(options))\n)\n```\n\n### Custom regular expressions\n\nUse the [RegExp](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp) constructor to create any regular expression.\n\n```js\nconst str = 'foo'\nconst regex = new RegExp('^' + str + 'bar', 'i')\nconst options = {\n  from: regex,\n  to: 'bar',\n}\n```\n\n### Using callbacks for `from`\nYou can also specify a callback that returns a string or a regular expression. The callback receives the name of the file in which the replacement is being performed, thereby allowing the user to tailor the search string. The following example uses a callback to produce a search string dependent on the filename:\n\n```js\nconst options = {\n  files: 'path/to/file',\n  from: (file) => new RegExp(file, 'g'),\n  to: 'bar',\n}\n```\n\n### Using callbacks for `to`\nAs the `to` parameter is passed to the native [String replace method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/replace), you can also specify a callback. The following example uses a callback to convert matching strings to lowercase:\n\n```js\nconst options = {\n  files: 'path/to/file',\n  from: /SomePattern[A-Za-z-]+/g,\n  to: (match) => match.toLowerCase(),\n}\n```\n\nThis callback provides for an extra argument above the String replace method, which is the name of the file in which the replacement is being performed. The following example replaces the matched string with the filename:\n\n```js\nconst options = {\n  files: 'path/to/file',\n  from: /SomePattern[A-Za-z-]+/g,\n  to: (...args) => args.pop(),\n}\n```\n\n### Saving to a different file\nYou can specify a `getTargetFile` config param to modify the target file for saving the new file contents to. For example:\n\n```js\nconst options = {\n  files: 'path/to/files/*.html',\n  getTargetFile: source => `new/path/${source}`,\n  from: 'foo',\n  to: 'bar',\n}\n```\n\n### Ignore a single file or glob\n\n```js\nconst options = {\n  ignore: 'path/to/ignored/file',\n}\n```\n\n### Ignore multiple files or globs\n\n```js\nconst options = {\n  ignore: [\n    'path/to/ignored/file',\n    'path/to/other/ignored_file',\n    'path/to/ignored_files/*.html',\n    'another/**/*.ignore',\n  ],\n}\n```\n\nPlease note that there is an [open issue with Glob](https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob/issues/309) that causes ignored patterns to be ignored when using a `./` prefix in your files glob. To work around this, simply remove the prefix, e.g. use `**/*` instead of `./**/*`.\n\n### Allow empty/invalid paths\nIf set to true, empty or invalid paths will fail silently and no error will be thrown. For asynchronous replacement only. Defaults to `false`.\n\n```js\nconst options = {\n  allowEmptyPaths: true,\n}\n```\n\n### Disable globs\nYou can disable globs if needed using this flag. Use this when you run into issues with file paths like files like `//SERVER/share/file.txt`. Defaults to `false`.\n\n```js\nconst options = {\n  disableGlobs: true,\n}\n```\n\n### Specify glob configuration\nSpecify configuration passed to the [glob](https://www.npmjs.com/package/glob) call:\n\n```js\nconst options = {\n  glob: {\n\n    //Glob settings here (examples given below)\n    dot: true, //To include file names starting with a dot\n    windowsPathsNoEscape: true, //To fix paths on Windows OS when path.join() is used to create paths\n  },\n}\n```\n\nPlease note that the setting `nodir` will always be passed as `false`.\n\n### Making replacements on network drives\nTo make replacements in files on network drives, you may need to specify the UNC path as the `cwd` config option. This will then be passed to glob and prefixed to your paths accordingly. See [#56](https://github.com/adamreisnz/replace-in-file/issues/56) for more details.\n\n### Specify character encoding\nUse a different character encoding for reading/writing files. Defaults to `utf-8`.\n\n```js\nconst options = {\n  encoding: 'utf8',\n}\n```\n\n### Dry run\nTo do a dry run without actually making replacements, for testing purposes. Defaults to `false`.\n\n```js\nconst options = {\n  dry: true,\n}\n```\n\n### Using custom processors\n\nFor advanced usage where complex processing is needed it's possible to use a callback that will receive content as an argument and should return it processed.\n\n```js\nconst results = await replaceInFile({\n  files: 'path/to/files/*.html',\n  processor: (input) => input.replace(/foo/g, 'bar'),\n})\n```\nThe custom processor will receive the path of the file being processed as a second parameter:\n\n```js\nconst results = await replaceInFile({\n  files: 'path/to/files/*.html',\n  processor: (input, file) => input.replace(/foo/g, file),\n})\n```\n\nThis also supports passing an array of functions that will be executed sequentially\n\n```js\nfunction someProcessingA(input) {\n  const chapters = input.split('###')\n  chapters[1] = chapters[1].replace(/foo/g, 'bar')\n  return chapters.join('###')\n}\n\nfunction someProcessingB(input) {\n  return input.replace(/foo/g, 'bar')\n}\n\nconst results = replaceInFileSync({\n  files: 'path/to/files/*.html',\n  processor: [someProcessingA, someProcessingB],\n})\n```\n\n### Using a custom file system API\n`replace-in-file` defaults to using `'node:fs/promises'` and `'node:fs'` to provide file reading and write APIs.\nYou can provide an `fs` or `fsSync` object of your own to switch to a different file system, such as a mock file system for unit tests.\n\n* For the asynchronous APIs, the provided `fs` must provide the `readFile` and `writeFile` methods.\n* For the synchronous APIs, the provided `fsSync` must provide the `readFileSync` and `writeFileSync` methods.\n\nCustom `fs` and `fsSync` implementations should have the same parameters and returned values as their [built-in Node `fs`](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html) equivalents.\n\n```js\nreplaceInFile({\n  from: 'a',\n  fs: {\n    readFile: async (file, encoding) => {\n      console.log(`Reading ${file} with encoding ${encoding}...`)\n      return 'fake file contents'\n    },\n    writeFile: async (file, newContents, encoding) => {\n      console.log(`Writing ${file} with encoding ${encoding}: ${newContents}`)\n    },\n  },\n  to: 'b',\n})\n```\n\nOr for the sync API:\n\n```js\nreplaceInFileSync({\n  from: 'a',\n  fsSync: {\n    readFileSync: (file, encoding) => {\n      console.log(`Reading ${file} with encoding ${encoding}...`)\n      return 'fake file contents'\n    },\n    writeFileSync: (file, newContents, encoding) => {\n      console.log(`Writing ${file} with encoding ${encoding}: ${newContents}`)\n    },\n  },\n  to: 'b',\n})\n```\n\n## CLI usage\n\n```sh\nreplace-in-file from to some/file.js,some/**/glob.js\n  [--configFile=config.json]\n  [--ignore=ignore/files.js,ignore/**/glob.js]\n  [--encoding=utf-8]\n  [--disableGlobs]\n  [--verbose]\n  [--quiet]\n  [--dry]\n```\n\nMultiple files or globs can be replaced by providing a comma separated list.\n\nThe flags `--disableGlobs`, `--ignore` and `--encoding` are supported in the CLI.\n\nThe setting `allowEmptyPaths` is not supported in the CLI as the replacement is\nsynchronous, and this setting is only relevant for asynchronous replacement.\n\nTo list the changed files, use the `--verbose` flag. Success output can be suppressed by using the `--quiet` flag.\n\nTo do a dry run without making any actual changes, use `--dry`.\n\nA regular expression may be used for the `from` parameter by passing in a string correctly formatted as a regular expression. The library will automatically detect that it is a regular expression.\n\nThe `from` and `to` parameters, as well as the files list, can be omitted if you provide this\ninformation in a configuration file.\n\nYou can provide a path to a configuration file\n(JSON) with the `--configFile` flag. This path will be resolved using\nNode’s built in `path.resolve()`, so you can pass in an absolute or relative path.\n\nIf you are using a configuration file, and you want to use a regular expression for the `from` value, ensure that it starts with a `/`, for example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"from\": \"/cat/g\",\n  \"to\": \"dog\",\n}\n```\n\n## A note on using globs with the CLI\nWhen using the CLI, the glob pattern is handled by the operating system. But if you specify the glob pattern in the configuration file, the package will use the glob module from the Node modules, and this can lead to different behaviour despite using the same pattern.\n\nFor example, the following will only look at top level files:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"from\": \"cat\",\n  \"to\": \"dog\",\n}\n```\n\n```sh\nreplace-in-file **  --configFile=config.json\n```\n\nHowever, this example is recursive:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"files\": \"**\",\n  \"from\": \"cat\",\n  \"to\": \"dog\",\n}\n```\n\n```sh\nreplace-in-file --configFile=config.json\n```\n\nIf you want to do a recursive file search as an argument you must use:\n\n```sh\nreplace-in-file $(ls l {,**/}*)  --configFile=config.json\n```\n\n## Version information\nFrom version 8.0.0 onwards, this package requires Node 18 or higher. If you need support for older versions of Node, please use a previous version of this package.\n\nAs 8.0.0 was a significant rewrite, please [open an issue](https://github.com/adamreisnz/replace-in-file/issues) if you run into any problems or unexpected behaviour.\n\nSee the [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md) for more information.\n\n## License\n(MIT
